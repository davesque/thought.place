title: In the Beginning
---

In the beginning, there was nothing&hellip;or something.  It matters not
because no one knew which was which.  The universe continued this way for a
while and it was fine.  Then, one thing became separate.  This separate thing
was named "true".  Once one thing was separate, there was no denying a simple
question: if "true" was one thing, then what was there that was not "true"?
The question had a simple answer: what was not "true" was "false".
